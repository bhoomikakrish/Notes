Step1 : Install jenkins 
Step2: create IAM user & group then give s3 full access to that group
Step3: Select Created user then Security credentials here we can genrate access key and Secreate key
Step4: Go to jenkins install S3 Publisher plugin
Step5: Create pipeline job(Jenkins-Backup) then go to configure select pipeline write jenkins file
Step6: on upload s3 section was created by pipeline syntax (Select pipeline syntax > s3Upload: Publish artifacts to s3 Bucket, S3 profile=s3 backup, click on Files to upload Source =*.zip, Exclude=empty, Destination Bucket =Jenkins_Backup.zip, Storage class=standard, Bucket Region=ap-south-1, Publish Failure Result Constraint
=Failure, Build console log level?=INFO ) Genearate syntax.
Step7: To copy zip file from s3 bucket to inside instance 
        aws s3 cp s3://jenkins-backup-for-1/Jenkins_Backup.zip <destination location>

    agent any
